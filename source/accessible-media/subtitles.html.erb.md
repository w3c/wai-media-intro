## Subtitle basics

Subtitles (also known as foreign-language subtitles) are, from a
technical perspective, similar to captions: they are text (or sometimes
images of text) presented through markup that contains timing
information and positioning codes. They can be created using the same
authoring tools as captions, and they can also be delivered using the
same basic timed-text markup formats:

-   [Web Video Text Tracks (WebVTT)](https://w3c.github.io/webvtt/)
-   [Timed Text Markup Language
    (TTML)](https://www.w3.org/TR/ttaf1-dfxp/)
-   [SRT](https://matroska.org/technical/specs/subtitles/srt.html)

And, as with captions, they can be open or closed:

-   **Closed subtitles** can be hidden and revealed by users, typically
    by operating a button or menu on the player's control bar.
-   **Open subtitles** are continually displayed and cannot be turned off.

In instances where subtitles cannot be presented using true text, they
can instead be presented as bitmaps: in other words, pictures of text or
other symbols. The bitmaps themselves can still be transmitted using
markup, though, by using [TTML Profiles for Internet Media Subtitles and
Captions 1.0 (IMSC1)](https://www.w3.org/TR/ttml-imsc1/). Bitmap subtitles/captions cannot be customized by users, which may diminish their usefulness to viewers with certain types of visual impairments.  Learn more about [why caption customization is important](production-captions.html#custom_cc).

## Differences between subtitles and captions

Subtitles are not the same as captions, nor are they aimed at the same
audiences. Here are some of the basic differences.

##Delivering subtitles to viewers

Subtitles are delivered to viewers using HTML5's `<track>` element.
`<track>` is used as a child element of the `<video>` element. Be sure
to set the value of the `kind` attribute to `"subtitles"` and to specify
the language in the `label` attribute:

{::nomarkdown}
<%= code_start %>
{:/nomarkdown}

~~~html
<video controls>
    <source src="myvideo.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    <track kind="subtitles" src="my_italian_subtitles.vtt" srclang="it" label="Italian" default />
</video>
~~~

{::nomarkdown}
<%= code_end %>
{:/nomarkdown}

In some cases, it may be necessary to use captions and subtitles
together: for example, if an important sound effect is used in the audio
track, that sound can be conveyed through a single sound-effect caption
placed near the subtitle, as shown in the image below.
