Captions and audio descriptions make online media accessible to people with disabilities. This tutorial will demonstrate how to add captions and audio descriptions to online media. In addition to captions and audio descriptions, other techniques, such as transcripts and foreign-language subtitles are available to ensure more accessible media.
{:#cc+ad_purpose}

-   [**Captions**](production-captions.html) provide a text version of the video’s dialogue, narration,
    or other spoken words. They are synchronized with the program audio and
    displayed within the media player. Include text
    identifying audible non-speech information, such as music and sound effects.
-   [**Subtitles**](subtitles.html) are a synchronized textual version of a media’s audio track,
    translated into another language.
-   [**Transcripts**](transcript.html) are a text version of a video’s audio track,
    containing narration, dialog and non-speech information such as
    speaker-identification cues. Transcripts can be static or
    interactive documents. Interactive transcripts can be synchronized to the media: words are highlighted automatically as they are spoken, or
    users can select words to move to that spot in the
    video.
-   [**Audio descriptions**](production-audio-description.html) are an extra track of narration that conveys
    information about important visuals, such as body
    language, changes in scenery and context, charts and
    diagrams.

## What are high-quality captions and audio descriptions?

In the same way that low-quality, incomplete audio is unacceptable to hearing viewers, low-quality captions-- those that do not accurately reflect the audio, or contain spelling and grammatical errors-- are unacceptable to deaf and hard-of-hearing viewers. Similarly, audio descriptions that provide misleading or inaccurate information, or
which provide unnecessary detail (e.g., by giving away clues or
answers), are of limited use to viewers who are blind or visually impaired.

## Why is this important?

Besides providing crucial communication access for viewers who are deaf, hard of hearing, blind or visually impaired, captions and descriptions have benefits beyond their original target
audiences:

-   Students and adults with cognitive disabilities can engage more directly with media when captions and audio descriptions are available as they help to focus attention or provide comprehension support.
-   Captions are useful when teaching children and adults how to read,
    or to enable people learn a foreign language.
-   Everyone can use captions in noisy
    environments such as a bar, an airport lounge, or in any place
    where it would be inappropriate to turn up the volume.
-   Search engines can use captions as a way to locate information in media.
-   Audio descriptions can reinforce complex visual concepts, which is
    especially useful for children or adults with learning disabilities.

For a quick overview on determining whether or not captions and audio
descriptions are necessary, see the [caption/description decision
tree](decision-tree.html).
