Captions, audio descriptions, and transcripts are required to make video and audio media accessible to people with disabilities. This tutorial demonstrates how to add captions, subtitles, audio descriptions, and transcripts to video and audio.

-   [**Captions**](production-captions.html) are a text version of audio, including dialogue, narration, and non-speech information such as music and sound effects. Captions are synchronized with the audio and displayed within the media player.

-   [**Subtitles**](subtitles.html) are a text version of the dialogue and narration translated into another language. Subtitles are synchronized with the audio and displayed within the media player.

-   [**Transcripts**](transcript.html) are a text version of audio, including dialogue, narration, and speaker identification. Some transcripts include non-speech audio information. Transcripts can be static or interactive. Interactive transcripts can be synchronized with the media so that words are highlighted as they are spoken, and users can select words to move to that spot in the video.

-   [**Audio descriptions**](production-audio-description.html) are an audio or text version of important visual information, such as body language, changes in scenery and context, charts, and diagrams. Audio descriptions are usually provided in a separate audio track.

## What are high-quality captions and audio descriptions?

Hearing viewers find low-quality, incomplete audio content unacceptable. Similarly, captions that are inaccurate or contain spelling and grammatical errors are unacceptable to deaf and hard-of-hearing viewers. Audio descriptions that provide misleading or inaccurate information, or which provide unnecessary detail (e.g., by giving away clues or answers), are of limited use to viewers who are blind or visually impaired.

## Why is this important?

Besides providing crucial communication access for viewers who are deaf, hard of hearing, blind, visually impaired or deaf-blind, captions, audio descriptions and transcripts have benefits beyond their original target
audiences:

-   Captions, descriptions and transcripts can be used to help all viewers, especially those with cognitive disabilities, engage more directly with media, helping to focus attention or to provide comprehension support.
-   Captions are useful when teaching children and adults how to read,
    or to help people learn a foreign language.
-   Everyone can use captions in noisy
    environments such as a bar, an airport lounge, or in any place
    where it would be inappropriate to turn up the volume.
-   Search engines can use captions and transcripts as a way to locate information in media.
-   Audio descriptions can reinforce complex visual concepts, which is
    especially useful for children or adults with learning disabilities.

For a quick overview on determining whether or not captions and audio
descriptions are necessary, see the [caption/description decision
tree](decision-tree.html).
